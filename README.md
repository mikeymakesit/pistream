# PiStream

Use a Raspberry Pi to stream video from a USB webcam to Twitch via a local nginx stream server.

This project makes lots of assumptions about your goals and the capabilities of your webcam:
- Which streaming service you want to use
- Which Twitch stream ingest location is right for you
- What resolution and framerate your cam supports
- Output stream bitrate that works for your ISP connectivity
- etc.

It probably won't work for you, but it could!

Clone the project and install with:

`sudo bash setup.sh`
